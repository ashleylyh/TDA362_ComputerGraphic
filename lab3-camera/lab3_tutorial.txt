Exercise 1: 
What does the model matrix transform? (strictly speaking)?
: the car model is rotated/translated 
Will RT produce the same transformation as TR? Why/Why not?
: No, as we have learned in any other course in linear algebra, the matrix multiplication A x B is not commutative, hence A x B =/= B x A

Exercise 2: 
Z-fighting: increase near place / decrease far place
