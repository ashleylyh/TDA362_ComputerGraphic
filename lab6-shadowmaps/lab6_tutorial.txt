Exercise1: Other types of lights
Q1: We have created a shadow for a spotlight by using a perspective projection when rendering the shadowmap.
How would you implement something similar but for the sun, where the rays can be considered to be parallel everywhere accross the scene, instead of converging to a point?

A1: use an orthographic projection when rendering the shadow map. it captures the parellel nature of sunlight, resulting in uniform and directionally consistent shadow.

Q2: How about having a point light with shadows all around?

A2: use a depth cube map from the point light's perspective to render the scene and capture the views in all 6 cardinal direction (up, down, left, right, forward, backward) for the shadown map.


Exercise2: hy Percentage Closer Filtering
Why don't we just compare the reference against the interpolated depth?

comparing fragment depth to interpolated shadownmap depth can create aliasling artifact near shadow edges
